# Contributing to Séance

Thanks for considering a contribution. A few notes to save time.

## Filing issues

- Use one of the issue templates. Bug reports without a version, distro, and repro step are hard to act on.
- For feature ideas that are bigger than a single commit, open a Discussion first so we can talk about shape before anyone writes code.
- Agent support requests (new agents to auto-track) have their own template. The hook-system question is the important one.

## Building from source

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/no1msd/seance.git
cd seance
zig build
./zig-out/bin/seance
```

You need Zig 0.16.x, GTK4, libadwaita, OpenGL 4.3+, and Linux. The submodule (`ghostty`) must be checked out for libghostty to build.

The fork's [patch ledger](ghostty/SEANCE_PATCHES.md) documents the embedding
changes that must survive upstream updates. Run `zig build test` and
`xvfb-run zig build e2e`, then exercise scrollback restore, clipboard, and pane
reparenting with:

```bash
SEANCE_TEST_BINARY="$PWD/zig-out/bin/seance" xvfb-run python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_ghostty_integration.py' -v
```

Run the Codex wrapper regression tests with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.
Set `SEANCE_TEST_CODEX` to the real Codex binary (outside Séance's wrapper directory)
to also check hook loading and approval persistence using its local app-server.
This check uses a temporary Codex home and makes no model calls.

Physical keyboard remap tests require `Xvfb`, `xdotool`, and `setxkbmap`.
They create a separate X server and never modify your desktop's keyboard layout:

```bash
SEANCE_TEST_BINARY="$PWD/zig-out/bin/seance" python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_keyboard_remaps.py' -v
```

IME tests also use isolated X servers. They exercise GTK's compose engine and a
test input context for Korean syllable transitions, asynchronous commits, focus,
and cursor positioning. The test context requires a C compiler and GTK4 headers:

```bash
SEANCE_TEST_BINARY="$PWD/zig-out/bin/seance" python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_ime.py' -v
```

For a desktop check, build and launch `./zig-out/bin/seance` at your next restart
so an older running instance does not handle the launch. Enable your Korean
input method and type `안녕` followed by a space. Also insert Korean text into the
middle of an existing shell command, and switch panes during composition. Check
that syllables appear once, the candidate popup follows the cursor, and ordinary
typing and shortcuts still work after switching back. The automated X11 tests do
not replace this check with your usual IME on Wayland. Switch back to your normal
input method when finished.

## Code style

- Match existing style. Zig source uses the standard formatter (`zig fmt`).
- Keep functions small. If a function is growing past ~80 lines, look for a natural split.
- Comments should explain *why*, not *what*. Identifiers are for the what.
- Don't introduce dependencies without opening a Discussion first. The binary's "one file" feel matters.

## Pull requests

- One focused change per PR. Bundled refactors make reviewing slow.
- Include a short description that says what changed and why, not only what.
- If the change is user-visible, update the README if it's covered there.
- CI must pass before merge.

## Adding support for a new agent

The hook injection layer lives in a single file and is the main integration point. To add a new agent:

1. Identify the agent's hook or notification system. If it has one, write an injection routine that sets up config/env pointing at our hook commands.
2. Map its lifecycle events onto Séance's three states: working, waiting for permission, idle.
3. Add a detection check so Séance recognises when a new pane is running this agent.
4. Update the README's "Why Séance?" section and the bundled skill file if the agent exposes meaningful scriptable surface.

PR with the integration and a short note on how you tested it. I'll merge quickly if it's self-contained.
